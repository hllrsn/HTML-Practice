        <h2>Bio:</h2>

            <p>Ludovico Maria Enrico Einaudi, born November 23, 1955, is an Italian pianist and composer. He began his career as a classical composer, and then began incorporating other styles and genres, including pop, rock, world music, and folk music.</p>

            <p>Ludovico Einaudi is known the world over through films and TV. His music has featured in titles including 'Black Swan', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'This is England', and many more. In 2011, his track 'I Giorni' was played on Radio 1, and his haunting melodies are timeless in their beauty.</p>

            <p>His acclaimed album 'In a Time Lapse' was released on January 21, 2013, with US and Canadian supporting tours, and composed over a period of two years and recorded in October 2012 in a monastery near Verona. On September 17, 2013, Einaudi performed various songs from 'In a Time Lapse', together with a new ensemble, at the annual iTunes Festival held at the Roundhouse in London. The group intimately rehearsed this performance in the barn of Einaudi's house. Epic and emotional as his bestselling album 'Divenire', experimental and adventurous as 'Nightbook', 'In A Time Lapse' goes further by incorporating baroque and Italian folk music, late romantic strings textures, and a wide variety of colors through percussion and electronics. The theme is a deep reflection on the idea of time; in the words of Einaudi, 'When you get conscious that our time is limited, it's the moment where you try to fill that space with all your energy and emotions... and live every moment of your life fully as when you were a child.'</p>
